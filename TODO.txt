Exposing libxml2 functionalities
--------------------------------

* Test XML entities, also in an ElementTree context.


In general
----------

* test namespaces more in-depth

* will namespace nodes of unknown namespaces be added (and never freed?)

* more testing on multi-threading


ElementTree
-----------

* _setroot(), even though this is not strictly a public method.


QName
-----

* expose prefix support?


Objectify
---------

* emulate setting special __attributes__ on ObjectifiedElement's as Python
  attributes, not XML children


Features
--------

* RelaxNG compact notation (rnc versus rng) support.  Currently not supported
  by libxml2 (patch exists)
